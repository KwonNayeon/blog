Welcome to my personal website! I'm Nayeon, a data scientist passionate about building meaningful insights through data.

My journey started in business at [Kyung Hee University](https://www.khu.ac.kr/eng/user/main/view.do), where I discovered my passion for data science. This led me to study Statistics at [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/), where I specialized in causal inference and machine learning as part of the [Bayesian Causal Inference Group](https://bci.creatorlink.net/). Most recently, I worked as a Statistical Analyst at [Statistics Korea](https://kostat.go.kr/anse/), handling census data analysis and pipeline development.

Currently, I'm embracing a new challenge by transitioning to a data science role in Canada, as pushing beyond comfort zones drives my growth. Through this website, I share my projects and learning experiences in data science.

Stay connected!
